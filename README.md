# SecondChallengePacs

1. Introduction
This challenge involves coding a sparse matrix representation and implementing various operations on it. The primary tasks include implementing matrix-vector multiplication (Av), reading matrices from the Matrix Market format, and testing the code's performance under different scenarios.

Makefile
The makefike should work without problem. Make sure you have a compiler Compatibility: The Makefile assumes the g++ compiler is available. If someone is using a different compiler or if g++ is not installed, they would need to change the CXX variable to match their compiler.
