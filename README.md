# SecondChallengePacs

## Introduction

This project involves the implementation of a sparse matrix representation and performing various operations on it. The primary tasks include:

- Implementing matrix-vector multiplication (Av)
- Reading matrices from the Matrix Market format
- Testing the performance of the code under different scenarios

## Prerequisites

The Makefile assumes the `g++` compiler is available. If you're using a different compiler or if `g++` is not installed, you would need to change the `CXX` variable in the Makefile to match your compiler.
